# Real Time Chat Web Application.

It is a Real-Time Chat Web Application made using Socket.IO. Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

It also has a login/Registration facility in which only authorized persons can access the chat page by using their ID & Password. The details of each individual will save in the database when they sign up for the application.


All the packages I used in this project depend on the NodeJs environment. Node.js (Node) is an open source, a cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.
